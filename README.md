View the prototype here: 

http://atiumcache.pythonanywhere.com/

We are currently working on improved CSS and additional functionality.

With an optimized UX/UI, this app will be utilized by chefs and cooks around the world, both professional and amateur.

## Usage

Input an ingredient and receive a list of potentially-delicous ingredient pairings. 

## FAQ

### Why build a flavor pairings web app?

In former years, I have worked as a chef and kitchen manager. One of my favorite food-related books, *The Flavor Bible*, provides invaluable ingredient pairing information. 

However, the book is large and unwieldly, and it can be impractically slow to look up various ingredients. 

So, I wanted to build a digital version of the information, allowing users to quickly access flavor pairing information.

### Where does the data come from?

The data is scraped from a PDF version of a fantastic book, _The Flavor Bible_. The data was added to a CSV file. 

We decided to have the program manually clean the data every time it runs, as this would allow the data file to be added to or altered. Or, the app could be used with a completely different set of data. 

### What future work is planned?

- Search for 2 or more ingredients at once.
- Visualize flavor connections with an interactive graph/network.
- Improve UI/UX.
