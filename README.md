## FAQ

### Why build a flavor pairings web app?

As a former chef and kitchen manager, I've utilized "The Flavor Bible," a book providing invaluable ingredient pairing information. However, the physical book can be cumbersome and slow to navigate. This app is a digital homage to that resource, offering quick and easy access to a wealth of flavor pairing information.

### Where does the data come from?

The data is scraped from a PDF version of "The Flavor Bible" and organized into a CSV file.

To ensure flexibility and continuous improvement, the app is designed to clean and process the data with each run. This approach allows for easy updates and modifications to the dataset or even using a completely different set of data.

### What future work is planned?

- **Ingredient Combinations**: Search for 2 or more ingredients simultaneously to explore complex pairings.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualize flavor connections with an interactive graph/network, enhancing the user's ability to discover new and exciting combinations.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Ongoing enhancements to the user interface and experience to make the app more intuitive and visually appealing.
